Data Model 
Data model is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one other and to the properties of real world entities.

Why is data modeling important?
	• Really imporant to organize data
	• Orgainzed data determines later data use
	• Begin prior to building out applications, business logic and analytical mode.
	• Iterative process
	
**	Relational Model**
	Organizes data into one or more tables of columns and rows, with a unique key, identifying each row
	
**	Relational Data base**
	It is a digital databse on the relational model of data…a software system used to maintain relational databases 
	Common types of RDBMS:
	• MySQL
	• PostgreSQL
	• Oracle
	• MSSQL

RDBMS --> ACID prop

**REQUIREMENTS:**
	1. Install MySQL
	2. Python 3.6 or later version
	3. Jupyter Notebook

Project Name: Database Creation with Python
**Requirements**
**MySQL:**
Ensure that MySQL is installed on your machine. You can download it from MySQL official website.

**Python 3.6 or later version:**
Make sure you have Python 3.6 or a later version installed. You can download it from Python official website.

**Jupyter Notebook:**
Jupyter Notebook is required to run the Python script. You can install it using the following command:
bash
Copy code
pip install notebook
Project Setup

**My Contributions:**

Implemented the Python script to connect to MySQL and create a table named 'users'.
Utilized Jupyter Notebook for an interactive development environment.
Handled error scenarios using try, except, and finally blocks.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
Python, MySQL, Database Management, Jupyter Notebook, Error Handling

https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/index.html?path=notebooks%2Fcreate+db.ipynb

**Output**
Success Output:
If the script executes successfully, the output should be:

Table 'users' created successfully.

Error Output:
If there's an error during the execution (e.g., connection error, syntax error, etc.), the script will print an error message. For example:

Error: <error_message>

Connection Error Output:
If there is an issue connecting to the MySQL server, the error might look like:

Error: 2003: Can't connect to MySQL server on 'myhost' (timed out)
