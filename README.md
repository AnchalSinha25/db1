Why is data modeling important?
	• Really imporant to organize data
	• Orgainzed data determines later data use
	• Begin prior to building out applications, business logic and analytical mode.
	• Iterative process
	
**	Relational Model**
	Organizes data into one or more tables of columns and rows, with a unique key, identifying each row
	
**	Relational Data base**
	It is a digital databse on the relational model of data…a software system used to maintain relational databases 
	Common types of RDBMS:
	• MySQL
	• PostgreSQL
	• Oracle
	• MSSQL

RDBMS --> ACID prop

**REQUIREMENTS:**
	1. Install MySQL
	2. Python 3.6 or later version
	3. Jupyter Notebook

Project Name: Database Creation with Python
**Requirements**
**MySQL:**
Ensure that MySQL is installed on your machine. You can download it from MySQL official website.

**Python 3.6 or later version:**
Make sure you have Python 3.6 or a later version installed. You can download it from Python official website.

**Jupyter Notebook:**
Jupyter Notebook is required to run the Python script. You can install it using the following command:
bash

pip install notebook
Project Setup

**My Contributions:**

Implemented the Python script to connect to MySQL and create a table named 'users'.
Utilized Jupyter Notebook for an interactive development environment.
Handled error scenarios using try, except, and finally blocks.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
Python, MySQL, Database Management, Jupyter Notebook, Error Handling
